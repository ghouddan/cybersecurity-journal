#### Task manager (Windows)
Task ManagerÂ is a built-inÂ GUI-based Windows utility that allows users to see what is running on the Windows system. It also provides information on resource usage, such as how much each process utilizesÂ CPUÂ and memory. When a program is not responding, the Task Manager is used to terminate the process.
here is summary of the process that are considered normal behavior
- System
- System > smss.exe
- csrss.exe
- wininit.exe
- wininit.exe > services.exe
- wininit.exe > services.exe > svchost.exe
- lsass.exe
- winlogon.exe
- explorer.exe
#### Sysinternals

here we will see two utility used for end-point security 
- TCPView : networking tool
- Process Explorer: Process tool 
#### Windows Event Logs
The Windows Event Logs are not text files that can be viewed using a text editor. However, the raw data can be translated intoÂ XMLÂ using the WindowsÂ API. The events in these log files are stored in a proprietary binary format with a .evt or .evtxÂ extension. The log files with the .evtxÂ file extension typically reside inÂ `C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs`.
There are three main ways of accessing these event logs within a Windows system:
1. Event ViewerÂ (GUI-based application)
2. Wevtutil.exeÂ (command-line tool)
3. Get-WinEventÂ (PowerShell cmdlet)

Osquery is an open-source tool created by Facebook. With Osquery, Security Analysts, Incident Responders, and Threat Hunters can query an endpoint (or multiple endpoints) using SQL syntax. Osquery can be installed on various platforms: Windows, Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD
#### Wazuh
ï»¿WazuhÂ is an open-source, freely available, and extensiveÂ EDR (is a series of tool for end-point detection and response )Â solution, which Security Engineers can deploy in all scales of environments.
ï»¿As mentioned,Â WazuhÂ is anÂ EDR; let's briefly run through what anÂ EDRÂ is.Â Endpoint detection and response (EDR) are tools and applications that monitor devices for an activity that could indicate a threat or security breach. These tools and applications have features that include:  

- Auditing a device for common vulnerabilities
- Proactively monitoring a device for suspicious activity such as unauthorized logins, brute-force attacks, or privilege escalations.
- Visualizing complex data and events into neat and trendy graphs
- Recording a device's normal operating behaviour to help with detecting anomalies

## Windows core process 
#### Task manager 
In windows the process are categorized under three type :
- app
- windows processes 
- background processes
Windows process:
- **system** is the home for kernel process always have the pid 4
- Â **smss.exe** "Session Manager Subsystem" the first the first user mode process started it lunches two essential process 
	- **winlogon.exe** : responsible for user login  is responsible for handling theÂ **Secure Attention Sequence**Â (SAS). It is the ALT+CTRL+DELETE key combination users press to enter their username & password. This process is also responsible for loading the user profile. It loads the user's NTUSER.DAT into HKCU, and userinit.exe loads the user's shell. 
		- Â **userinit.exe**
			- Â **explorer.exe** this process gives the user access to their folders and files. It also provides functionality for other features, such as the Start Menu and Taskbar.
	- **csrss.exe** : responsible for other server client proecss |have no parent it get called by smss and them self terminat 
	- **wininit.exe** is responsible for lunching services.exe, Â lsass.exe, lsaiso.exe
		- **services.exe**  : it main responsibility is to hundel system service 
			- **svchost.exe**, is responsible for hosting and managing Windows services.
		- **lsass.exe** "Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (**LSASS**) is a process in Microsoft Windows operating systems that is responsible for enforcing the security policy on the system. It verifies users logging on to a Windows computer or server, handles password changes, and creates access tokens. It also writes to the Windows Security Log."

## # Sysinternals
is  a list of tools that are organized in one suite for windows computer it contain multiple tool that are categorized under 
- File and Disk Utilities
- Networking Utilities
- Process Utilities
- Security Utilities
- System Information
- Miscellaneous

for working with live sysinternals you nee to do two thing 
- start the webClient process 
- Enable Network discovery trought the control center 
### Disk utility 
#### **Sigcheck** 
is one of the tools used for disk analysis it's a command line tool 
for example `sigcheck -u -e C:\Windows\System32`
#### **Streams**
for checking NFTS file system 
	Alternate Data StreamsÂ (ADS) is a file attribute specific to WindowsÂ NTFSÂ (New Technology File System). Every file has at least one data stream ($DATA) and ADS allows files to contain more than one stream of data. Natively Window Explorer doesn't display ADS to the user. There are 3rd party executables that can be used to view this data, butÂ PowershellÂ gives you the ability to view ADS for files.
#### **SDelete**
	SDeleteÂ is a command line utility that takes a number of options. In any given use, it allows you to delete one or more files and/or directories, or to cleanse the free space on a logical disk.

### Network utility 
#### **TCPView**

### Process utility 
#### **Autoruns**
	"This utility, which has the most comprehensive knowledge of auto-starting locations of any startup monitor, shows you what programs are configured to run during system bootup or login, and when you start various built-in Windows applications like Internet Explorer, Explorer and media players. These programs and drivers include ones in your startup folder, Run, RunOnce, and other Registry keys.Â **Autoruns**Â reports Explorer shell extensions, toolbars, browser helper objects, Winlogon notifications, auto-start services, and much more.Â Autoruns goes way beyond other autostart utilities."Â (official definition)

**Note**: This is a good tool to search for any malicious entries created in the local machine to establishÂ **Persistence**.

#### **ProcDump**
	**ProcDump**Â is a command-line utility whose primary purpose is monitoring an application forÂ CPUÂ spikes and generating crash dumps during a spike that an administrator or developer can use to determine the cause of the spike."Â (official definition)

#### **Process Explorer**
![](./../images/Pasted image 20250529095940.png)

#### **Process Monitor**
	"Process Monitor is an advanced monitoring tool for Windows that shows real-time file system, Registry and process/thread activity. It combines the features of two legacy Sysinternals utilities, Filemon and Regmon, and adds an extensive list of enhancements including rich and non-destructive filtering, comprehensive event properties such as sessionÂ IDsÂ and user names, reliable process information, full thread stacks with integrated symbol support for each operation, simultaneous logging to a file, and much more. Its uniquely powerful features will make Process Monitor a core utility in your system troubleshooting and malware hunting toolkit." (**official definition**)
#### **PsExec**
	**PsExec**Â is a light-weight telnet-replacement that lets you execute processes on other systems, complete with full interactivity for console applications, without having to manually install client software. PsExec's most powerful uses include launching interactive command-prompts on remote systems and remote-enabling tools like IpConfig that otherwise do not have the ability to show information about remote systems

### Security 
#### **Sysmon**
System Monitor (Sysmon) is a Windows system service and device driver that, once installed on a system, remains resident across system reboots to monitor and log system activity to the Windows event log. It provides detailed information about process creations, network connections, and changes to file creation time. By collecting the events it generates using Windows Event Collection orÂ SIEMÂ agents and subsequently analyzing them, you can identify malicious or anomalous activity and understand how intruders and malware operate on your network

### System information 
#### **WinObj**
	"**WinObj**Â is a 32-bit Windows NT program that uses the native Windows NTÂ APIÂ (provided by NTDLL.DLL) to access and display information on the NT Object Manager's name space." (**official definition**)

### **Miscellaneous**
#### **BgInfo**
	"It automatically displays relevant information about a Windows computer on the desktop's background, such as the computer name, IP address, service pack version, and more." (**official definition**)
#### **RegJump**
	"This little command-line applet takes a registry path and makes Regedit open to that path. It accepts root keys in standard (e.g. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE) and abbreviated form (e.g. HKLM)."Â (official definition)

# Room 4
##  **Windows Event Logs**

- **System Logs:**Â Records events associated with the Operating System segments. They may include information about hardware changes, device drivers, system changes, and other activities related to the device.
- **Security Logs:**Â Records events connected to logon and logoff activities on a device. The system's audit policy specifies the events. The logs are an excellent source for analysts to investigate attempted or successful unauthorized activity.
- **Application Logs**Â :Records events related to applications installed on a system. The main pieces of information include application errors, events, and warnings.
- **Directory Service Events:**Â Active Directory changes and activities are recorded in these logs, mainly on domain controllers.
- **File Replication Service Events:**Â Records events associated with Windows Servers during the sharing of Group Policies and logon scripts to domain controllers, from where they may be accessed by the users through the client servers.
- **DNSÂ Event Logs:**Â DNSÂ servers use these logs to record domain events and to map out
- **Custom Logs:**Â Events are logged by applications that require custom data storage. This allows applications to control the log size or attach other parameters, such as ACLs, for security purposes.
![](./../images/Pasted image 20250529110805.png)
#### Â **wevtutil.exe**
	Per Microsoft, the wevtutil.exe tool "enables you to retrieve information about event logs and publishers. You can also use this command to install and uninstall event manifests, to run queries, and to export, archive, and clear logs.

#### **Get-WinEvent**
	This is aÂ PowerShellÂ cmdlet calledÂ **Get-WinEvent**. Per Microsoft, the Get-WinEvent cmdlet "gets events from event logs and event tracing log files on local and remote computers." It provides information on event logs and event log providers. Additionally, you can combine numerous events from multiple sources into a single command and filter using XPath queries, structuredÂ XMLÂ queries, and hash table queries

![](./../images/Pasted image 20250530101844.png)
![](./../images/Pasted image 20250530102118.png)
![](./../images/Pasted image 20250530102126.png)
When working with large event logs, per Microsoft, it's inefficient to send objects down the pipeline to aÂ `Where-Object`Â command. The use of the Get-WinEvent cmdlet'sÂ **FilterHashtable**Â parameter is recommended to filter event logs. We can achieve the same results as above by running the following command:
![](./../images/Pasted image 20250530102306.png)
![](./../images/Pasted image 20250530102413.png)
#### **Xpath (XMLÂ Path Language**)
![](./../images/Pasted image 20250530104523.png)
we build structure of the xpath query based on the xml file structure 
and it always can be started with a * or event

![](./../images/Pasted image 20250530104610.png)
![](./../images/Pasted image 20250530104630.png)
![](./../images/Pasted image 20250530104716.png)
we can combine two parametre in one call

# Room 5
#### **Sysmon**
System Monitor (Sysmon) is a Windows system service and device driver that, once installed on a system, remains resident across system reboots to monitor and log system activity to the Windows event log
for Sysmon o work it need to have a configuration file that can be created by the user of installed, this file contain what we call rules 
Sysmon include 29 type of event ID. here we will see one of the most used 
[[Sysmon_EventID]]

# Room 6
## **Osquery**
Osquery is an open-source agent created by Facebook in 2014. It converts the operating system into a relational database. It allows us to ask questions from the tables using SQL queries, like returning the list of running processes, a user account created on the host, and the process of communicating with certain suspicious domains. It is widely used by Security Analysts, Incident Responders, Threat Hunters, etc. Osquery can be installed on multiple platforms: Windows, Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD.

- `=`Â [equal]
- `<>`Â Â [not equal]
- `>`Â ,Â `>=`Â [greater than, greater than, or equal to]
- `<`Â ,Â `<=`Â [less than or less than or equal to]Â 
- `BETWEEN`Â [between a range]
- `LIKE`Â [pattern wildcard searches]
- `%`Â [wildcard, multiple characters]
- `_`Â [wildcard, one character]

Matching Wildcard Rules

Below is a screenshot from the OsqueryÂ [documentation](https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deployment/file-integrity-monitoring/)Â showing examples of using wildcards when used in folder structures:

- `%`Â : Match all files and folders for one level.
- `%%`Â : Match all files and folders recursively.
- `%abc`Â : Match all within-level ending in "abc".
- `abc%`Â : Match all within-level starting with "abc".

Matching Examples

- `/Users/%/Library`Â : Monitor for changes to every user's Library folder,Â _but not the contents within_Â .
- `/Users/%/Library/`Â : Monitor for changes to filesÂ _within_Â each Library folder, but not the contents of their subdirectories.
- `/Users/%/Library/%`Â : Same, changes to files within each Library folder.
- `/Users/%/Library/%%`Â : Monitor changes recursively within each Library.
- `/bin/%sh`Â : Monitor theÂ `bin`Â directory for changes ending inÂ `sh`Â .

# Room 7 
Â [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/)Â is an open-source, freely available and extensiveÂ EDRÂ solution. It can be used in all scales of environments.Â WazuhÂ operates on a management and agent module. Simply, a device is dedicated to runningÂ WazuhÂ named a manager, whereÂ WazuhÂ operates on a management and agent model where the manager isÂ responsible for managing agents installed on the devices youâd like to monitor.Â Let's look at this model in the diagram below:
Â ![](./../images/Pasted image 20250530191249.png)
Â WazuhÂ comes with many rules that enableÂ WazuhÂ to analyze log files and can be found inÂ `/var/ossec/ruleset/rules`. Some common applications include:

- Docker
- FTP
- WordPress
- SQLÂ Server
- MongoDB
- Firewalld
- And many, many more (approximately 900).
here is where we modify the wazuh agent config to add more entry "Â `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`" and this is for the manager "/var/ossec/ruleset/rules"
[[autitd]]
you can also use wazuh as an API endpoint where you can call it and manage it trough API call using curl  here is a documentation for wazuh endpoint [endpoint](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/api/reference.html)



# SIEM
# Room 1
#### intro to SIEM
SIEMÂ stands forÂ **Security Information and Event Management system**. It is a tool that collects data from various endpoints/network devices across the network, stores them at a centralized place, and performs correlation on them.

##### type of logs 
**1) Host-Centric Log Sources**
These are log sources that capture events that occurred within or related to the host. Some log sources that generate host-centric logs are Windows Event logs,Â Sysmon, Osquery, etc. 
**2) Network-Centric Log Sources**
Network-related logs are generated when the hosts communicate with each other or access the internet to visit a website. Some network-based protocols areÂ SSH,Â VPN,Â HTTP/s,Â FTP, etc. Examples of such events are:
- SSHÂ connection
- A file being accessed viaÂ FTP
- Web traffic
- A user accessing company's resources throughÂ VPN.

##### Importance ofÂ SIEM  

![Shows SOC Capabilities](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e8dd9a4a45e18443162feab/room-content/63724f4da84dd3cfbaf2937790910e20.png)Now that we have covered various types of logs, it's time to understand the importance ofÂ SIEM. As all these devices generate hundreds of events per second, examining the imglogs on each device one by one in case of any incident can be a tedious task. That is one of the advantages of having aÂ SIEMÂ solution in place. It not only takes logs from various sources in real-time but also provides the ability to correlate between events, search through the logs, investigate incidents and respond promptly. 
- Real-time log Ingestion
- Alerting against abnormal activities  
- 24/7 Monitoring and visibility
- Protection against the latest threats through early detection
- Data Insights and visualization
- Ability to investigate past incidents.
##### Log ingestion 
1) Agent / Forwarder:Â TheseÂ SIEMÂ solutions provide a lightweight tool called an agent (forwarder byÂ Splunk) that gets installed in the Endpoint. It is configured to capture all the important logs and send them to theÂ SIEMÂ server.  
2) Syslog:Â Syslog is a widely used protocol to collect data from various systems like web servers, databases, etc., are sent real-time data to the centralized destination.
3) Manual Upload:Â SomeÂ SIEMÂ solutions, likeÂ Splunk,Â ELK, etc., allow users to ingest offline data for quick analysis. Once the data is ingested, it is normalized and made available for analysis.
4) Port-Forwarding:Â SIEMÂ solutions can also be configured to listen on a certain port, and then the endpoints forward the data to theÂ SIEMÂ instance on the listening port.
