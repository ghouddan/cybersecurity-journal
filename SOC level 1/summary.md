The cyber landscape is constantly evolving and expanding to include and take over new technologies and field.
for that I have been interest in the filed from a long time for that I pursued my education in software engineering for the sole purpose of studying Cybersecurity but unfortunately, I did not or at least at Uni. but it was not a waist of time since I got to acquire much skills and knowledge in software programming and coding which I know would be of a great advantage in the security field. 
So while learning and building software I had some little time  aside to learn about security, this time that I gave to complete course for getting a hand on experience of the actual work done in the field 
# SOC Level 1 Summary 
in this path I got to learn about what is a SOC (Security Operation Center) what role it plays in the work force. 
Security Analyst is the person responsible for triage of event and early incident response also creating ticket, that was the first thing I learned in this course. what are the responsibility of a SAL1.
What was interesting about the course is that it involve a lot of labs that give you all the tool that you need to finish your tasks and project.
What I did learned and practice in this course can be grouped under two aspect  :

- Monitoring assets of interest and implementing the proper measurement to insure the full functioning
- Incident response, leveraging  Frame Works, Methodologies, tools and techniques  to find threats and terminate them to restore the system  

The sole thing that I found a bit hard and frustrating is the amount of data you have to get trough to find what you are looking for
